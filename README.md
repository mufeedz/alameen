# Al-Ameen School Website Redesign

## Project Purpose
This project is a complete redesign of the Al-Ameen Matriculation Higher Secondary School website. The goal is to deliver a modern, accessible, and visually appealing static website that effectively communicates the school's values, programs, and community to prospective students, parents, and stakeholders.

## Tech Stack
- **HTML5** (semantic markup)
- **Bootstrap 5** (responsive layout, no jQuery)
- **Modular CSS** using BEM methodology
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for lightweight interactivity
- **WCAG 2.1 AA** accessibility compliance

## Key Features
- Responsive design for all devices
- SEO and performance optimized
- Downloadable admissions forms (PDF/Word)
- Embedded maps (no contact forms)
- Subtle Islamic motifs and cultural design accents
- All content in English

## Deployment
The website is deployed as a static site using **GitHub Pages**. To view the live site or set up your own deployment:
1. Fork or clone this repository.
2. Push changes to the `main` branch.
3. Enable GitHub Pages in the repository settings (set source to `/ (root)` or `/docs` as needed).
