# Section Divider Scaling Fix - Task List

## Problem
Section dividers (e.g., `.section-divider`, `.gradient-divider`, `.ornament-divider`, `.section-divider-alt`) do not scale to full width on large screens, resulting in awkward gaps.

## Solution Overview
- Analyze divider HTML structure and CSS.
- Update divider CSS to use responsive width (e.g., width: 100vw or width: 100%) and ensure they are not constrained by container classes.
- Add media queries or use scalable SVG/backgrounds for natural scaling.
- Test on desktop and mobile to ensure no negative impact on smaller screens.
