# About Page Refactor & Completion Plan

## Overview
The current About page (`about.html`) is incomplete and lacks the depth, structure, and design polish of the Home page. This plan outlines the steps to bring the About page up to the same standard, following the design system and requirements in `about-us.md`, `website_redesign_specifications.md`, and `style-guide.md`.

---

## 1. Analysis of Current Issues
- Only basic sections are present; "Mission & Vision" and "Quick Facts" are placeholders.
- No "Our Trust" section (as required by the design guide).
- Lacks visual engagement: no images, icons, or calligraphic elements.
- No timeline or engaging layout for "Our History".
- No use of card-based or two-column layouts for mission/vision.
- Minimal use of Islamic design elements (patterns, dividers, etc.).
- No call-to-action or connection to other pages.
- No accessibility or semantic improvements.
