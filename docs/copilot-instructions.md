    - Support multi-level dropdowns if needed (e.g., for 'About Us' subsections: Our History, Mission & Vision, Our Trust). [cite: 38]
	- Implement back-to-top page navigation functionality.
- **Standard Structure**: header, hero, 2-3 main sections, footer.
- **Footer Specifics (for all pages)**:
    - The persistent footer on all pages should include:
        - School address(es) [cite: 39]
        - Contact info (phone, email) [cite: 39]
        - Social media icons/links [cite: 39]
        - Copyright notice [cite: 39]
        - Quick links (e.g., privacy policy, sitemap). [cite: 39]
- Implement a "skip-to-content" link for accessibility on all pages. [cite: 42]
- Use breadcrumb navigation if the page hierarchy is deep. [cite: 42]

## ðŸ§± CSS & BEM Conventions
- Follow BEM methodology: `block__element--modifier`. [cite: 5, 46]
- Global styles in `assets/css/main.css`.

## â™¿ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` text. [cite: 48, 49]
- Any embedded video must have captions or transcripts. [cite: 49]
- Pay attention to color contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, and use of ARIA labels where appropriate. [cite: 47]

## âš¡ Performance
- Leverage Bootstrap's utility classes to minimize custom CSS. [cite: 50]
- Lazy-load non-critical images. [cite: 50]
- Minify CSS/JS files for production. [cite: 50]
- Keep external dependencies (fonts, libraries) to a minimum for fast load times. [cite: 50]

## ðŸ’» Efficient JS
- Use lightweight JavaScript for interactivity. Avoid heavy frameworks; vanilla JS or small libraries are acceptable. [cite: 51, 52]
- If a calendar library is used for the Events page, it should be fully client-side (no backend). [cite: 52]
