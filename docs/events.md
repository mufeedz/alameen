## Sections & Features
1.  **Interactive Event Calendar**:
    * Embed a responsive, client-side JavaScript calendar. [cite: 30, 52]
    * The calendar should display upcoming school events, holidays, examination schedules, and other important dates. [cite: 30]
2.  **Event Data Source**:
    * Event data can be stored in a static JSON file (e.g., `assets/data/events.json`) or an iCal feed, rendered client-side by the JavaScript calendar. [cite: 31, 32]
3.  **Event Listings (Optional Complement to Calendar)**:
    * A chronological list of upcoming events below or beside the calendar, showing event title, date, time, and a brief description.
    * Past events could be archived on a separate section or page if desired.
4.  **Event Detail View (Optional)**:
    * Clicking on an event in the calendar or list could display more details (e.g., in a modal or a separate section).

## Styling
- The calendar should be clear, easy-to-read, and navigate.
- Ensure responsiveness across different screen sizes.
- Visually highlight current day and days with events.
