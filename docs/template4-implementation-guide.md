## Implementation Notes

- The implementation should be done incrementally, testing after each major component or page update
- Common components (header, footer) should be updated first to ensure consistency
- The home page should be prioritized as it showcases most components
- Mobile responsiveness should be tested throughout the implementation process

## Continuing Implementation

If implementation is interrupted, you can continue as follows:

1. Check the **Implementation Checklist** to see what has been completed
2. Review the status in the **Implementation Plan**
3. Continue with the next uncompleted task
4. Reference the appropriate guide for the current task
