   - Education model cards

2. **Mission Grid Section** (identical styling)
   - `mission-grid section position-relative py-5 mb-4`
   - `pattern-girih-bg` and `colored-bg-overlay`
   - Three columns: Contact Information, Campus Leadership, School Timings
   - Consistent icon usage and text formatting
