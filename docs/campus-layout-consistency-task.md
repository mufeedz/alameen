- [ ] Ensure consistent styling and layout structure

## Implementation Progress
- [x] Task 1: Campus Overview Card - âœ… Completed
- [x] Task 2: Mission Grid Section - âœ… Completed (Contact, Leadership, Timings)
- [x] Task 3: Enhanced Location Section - âœ… Completed 
- [x] Task 4: Final consistency check and validation - âœ… Completed

## Final Status: âœ… TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

Both campus sections now follow the exact same design pattern and structure:

### Consistent Structure Applied:
1. **Campus Overview Card** (`feature-card` with `p-4`)
   - Image gallery (left/right) with `arabesque-border` and `img-hover-zoom`
   - Campus details section with structured key highlights
   - Education model cards

2. **Mission Grid Section** (identical styling)
   - `mission-grid section position-relative py-5 mb-4`
   - `pattern-girih-bg` and `colored-bg-overlay`
   - Three columns: Contact Information, Campus Leadership, School Timings
   - Consistent icon usage and text formatting

3. **Location & Maps Section** (same layout)
   - `feature-card` wrapper with `p-4`
   - Side-by-side map and directions
   - Consistent directions list with transportation options
   - Same iframe ratio and styling

### Design Consistency Achieved:
- Same CSS classes and structure
- Consistent spacing and padding
- Identical icon usage and color scheme
- Matching typography and layout hierarchy
- Unified hover effects and interactive elements

The Ellapalayam Campus section now perfectly mirrors the Karungalpalayam Campus design while maintaining unique content appropriate for each campus.

## Final Update - Map Optimization Completed

### âœ… Additional Task Completed: Map Card Height and Width Optimization
**Date: Current Session**

**Changes Made:**
1. **Reduced Map Card Height**: Both campus map cards now have `style="height: 300px;"` for a more compact appearance
2. **Expanded Maps to Full Width**: Removed the row/column grid structure and replaced with full-width layout
3. **Updated Map Container Structure**:
   - Changed from `p-4` padding to `p-0` for edge-to-edge maps
   - Updated ratio from `ratio-16x9` to `ratio-21x9` for wider aspect ratio
   - Added `h-100` class to ensure maps fill the entire card height

**Technical Implementation:**
- **Before**: Maps occupied only 8/12 columns with padding around
- **After**: Maps now occupy the full card width with no padding, creating an immersive map experience
- Maps maintain responsiveness and proper aspect ratios
- Height reduced from auto-calculated based on content to fixed 300px

**Both Campuses Updated:**
- Karungalpalayam Campus map card optimized
- Ellapalayam Campus map card optimized
- Consistent styling applied to both locations

### ðŸŽ¯ ALL TASKS NOW COMPLETE
1. âœ… Campus layout consistency analysis
2. âœ… Ellapalayam campus restructuring 
3. âœ… Text removal from maps
4. âœ… Map card height and width optimization

The campus layout consistency project is now fully completed with all design elements unified across both campus sections.
