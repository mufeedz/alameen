## Content Structure
- This page can be a single page with distinct sections for each campus or two separate linked pages if content is extensive. [cite: 24]

## For Each Campus (Main Campus and Branch Campus):
1.  **Campus Name/Title**
2.  **Image Gallery/Hero Image**: High-quality photos showcasing the campus facilities and environment. [cite: 25]
3.  **Description**:
    * Detailed description of the campus.
    * Highlight unique features, facilities, and programs specific to that campus. [cite: 25]
4.  **Full Address**: Clearly displayed mailing address. [cite: 25]
5.  **Contact Information**: Specific phone numbers or email contacts for that campus, if different from general contact.
6.  **Google Maps Embed**: Embedded map for the specific campus location. [cite: 26]

## Design & Styling
- **Visually differentiate** the sections for each campus if on a single page (e.g., using slightly different accent colors, icons, or imagery styles that remain cohesive with the overall brand). [cite: 26]
- Ensure maps are responsive and easy to use.
