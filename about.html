                        <h4>Founding and Early Years</h4>
                        <p>The Al-Ameen Matriculation Higher Secondary School in Erode traces its roots to 1983 when it welcomed its first cohort of 30 students and 2 teachers in a rent-free thatched shed on Cauvery Road. The Al-Ameen School opened its doors on June 2, 1983, in this modest setting. Within a year, growth in enrollment and community support necessitated a move to a more permanent home on Wakf land—still rent-free—where the school’s main campus continues to thrive to this day.</p>

                        <h4 id="trust">Growth under the Trust</h4>
                        <p>Shortly after the school’s relocation, the Al-Ameen Educational & Charitable Trust was formalized in 1984, broadening its mission to encompass technical and professional education (e.g., Al-Ameen Polytechnic) alongside primary and secondary schooling. Governed by the Trust—established by Muslim philanthropists to uplift educational opportunities in rural Erode—the school has since expanded into two campuses (Karungalpalayam and Ellapalayam). Under the Trust’s stewardship, Al-Ameen School steadily enhanced its infrastructure, academic offerings, and community outreach programs, cementing its reputation in the Erode district.</p>
